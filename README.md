## Installation
```commandline
pip install fewsxml
```

## Overview

fewsxml provides Python APIs to construct, read, and write PI-XML files 
compatible with the Delft-FEWS system. It uses Pydantic models for data 
validation and supports the PI TimeSeries schema.

There are two main categories of functions:
1. **Creating PI-XML Files**: Functions to create PIHeader, PISeries, and PITimeSeries objects, and to write them to XML files.
2. **Reading PI-XML Files**: Functions to read and parse existing PI-XML files into Pydantic models.

## Usage Example

### Creating a PI-XML File and Writing to Disk

Below is a minimal example to create a PI-XML file with a time series, including all required header fields such as `timeStep` and `missVal`:

```python
from fewsxml import (
    create_pi_header, create_pi_series, create_pi_timeseries, write,
    PITimeStep
)
from datetime import datetime

time_step = PITimeStep(unit="second", multiplier=3600)

# Create the header with all required fields
header = create_pi_header(
    type="instantaneous",
    location_id="LOC001",
    parameter_id="H.waterlevel",
    start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1, 0, 0),
    end_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1, 2, 0),
    timeStep=time_step,
    missVal="-999"
)

# Create events (time series values)
events = [
    {"date": datetime(2023, 1, 1, 0, 0), "value": 1.23},
    {"date": datetime(2023, 1, 1, 1, 0), "value": 1.25},
    {"date": datetime(2023, 1, 1, 2, 0), "value": 1.20},
]

# Build the series and root object
series = create_pi_series(header, events)
pi = create_pi_timeseries(series)

# Write to XML file
write(pi, "output.xml")
```

### Reading a PI-XML File and Creating Pydantic Models

```python
import fewsxml as fx
parsed_timeseries = fx.read("timeseries_import.xml")
```

The `parsed_timeseries` variable now contains a `PITimeSeries` object 
with all data from the XML file, accessible via Pydantic models. As mentioned in the previous example, you can create an XML file 
from these models using the `write` function: `fx.write(parsed_timeseries, "output.xml")`. 
The created XML file will be compatible with the PI TimeSeries schema.

## API Reference

- `create_pi_header(...)`: Creates a PIHeader object (series metadata).
- `create_pi_series(header, events, ...)`: Creates a PISeries object from a header and events.
- `create_pi_timeseries(series, ...)`: Creates the root PITimeSeries object.
- `write(pi, filename)`: Writes a PITimeSeries object to an XML file.

## Schema Compatibility

The generated XML files are compatible with the [PI TimeSeries schema](https://fewsdocs.deltares.nl/schemas/version1.0/pi-schemas/pi_timeseries.xsd).
